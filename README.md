# IMPORTANT ISSUE (01/17/2020)
IMPORTANT: There is a setting in the current LGPO files that should not be set by default. As of 1/17/10...
a fix has been checked in to the "Pending" branch.  Once we confirm that resolves the issue we will merge...
into the "Master" branch.  The issue is that Windows will not check certificate information, and thus...
program installations could fail.  The temporary workaround is to open GPEDIT.MSC on the reference image...
The set the policy to "not configured".  Here is the location of the policy setting:

Local Computer Policy \ Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ System \ Internet Communication Management\ Internet Communication settings
"Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update"
